    "text": "I have always been fascinated by geography and the importance of “where”. Decisions from where should I get coffee today, or where should I sit in the library, to where should I live after graduation. I find “where” intriguing because you have to consider so many factors beyond location to make the most suitable choice. For this reason, I chose to minor in Spatial Science and complete the Geographic Information Science (GIS) series offered at UC Santa Barbara. I enjoy using GIS to understand the why a phenomena takes place where it does."

    "text": "Suitability Analysis of a Coffee Shop in Santa Barbara\nSuitability models can help visualize optimal locations using spatial analysis. I created a suitability model using the Model Builder using a weighted sum analysis for distance to existing cafes in Santa Barbara and distance to roads. The farther away a potential site was to an existing cage, and closer it was to a road indicated the most suitable location for a cafe. In the map, the highest value was in the mountains in Santa Barbara, because it was far from the cafes and close to the roads. The three parcels with the highest values are shown in the dark purple area."

    "text": "The Climate Action Program\nFor my ELI project, I worked with another Environmental Studies undergraduate student to create UCSB’s Climate Action Program (CAP). CAP is a six-week personal emissions reduction challenge for students to reduce their direct emissions from their diet, electricity consumption, water usage, and waste generation. The challenge is between UCSB campus organizations that register as teams. Individuals in each team track actions they take for sustainability on the Cool Campus Challenge website to earn points for their team and win prizes. Our hope is to inspire the UCSB community to make behavioral changes they will carry with them long after the program ends.\nWe came up with the idea by browsing through UC Santa Barbara’s climate initiatives and sustainability goals. We noticed there was a need for an incentive program to spark behavioral changes in students. In the Fall of 2022, we began planning our competition for the Spring quarter. After many mentor meetings, coffee chats, cold emailing, and outreach to student organizations, our competition began on April 17th.\nThere are ten participating teams and over 85 participants. Participants log actions on our website and earn points depending on how carbon-saving the action is. Prizes are drawn every week including beach towels, campus store gift cards, reusable bags, a hydroflask, and more. The top winner at the end will receive a trip to the Channel Islands for them and a friend. There has been high engagement with the program and people log actions every day. The inside of the website is included below."
